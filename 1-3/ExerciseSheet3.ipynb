    "**(A)** Implement the *bisection*, *secant*, *false position* and *Newton-Raphson* root finding methods, by coding your own version of these algorithms. Make sure to test your codes, checking that indeed they are able to find the root of a function (to do this, you can for example pick an analytic function that allows you test the codes and for which you can compute the roots analytically).\n",

    "The file ``omega_Cen_Sollima2009.txt`` contains a collection of measurements of line-of-sight velocities of stars in the Galactic globular cluster $\\omega$ Cen (NGC 5139). The first column in the file contains the values of the velocities (in km/s), and the second column the values of the associated measurement errors (also in km/s). These data are taken from [Sollima et al. (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.396.2183S/abstract).\n",

To do this, use **all** the python built-in functions we discussed in class, and compare the results you obtain. Print out the solutions you get, and verify that they are indeed solutions of the above equations.\n",
