    "## Exercise 1 - Radioactive decay\n",
    "\n",
    "Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. The fundamental law of radioactive decay is based on the fact that the decay, i.e. the transition of a parent nucleus to a daughter nucleus is a purely statistical process. The disintegration (decay) probability is a fundamental property of an atomic nucleus and remains equal in time. Mathematically this law is expressed as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d N}{dt} = - \\lambda N \\ , $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of radioactive nuclei, $dN/dt$ the variation of this number per unit of time, and $\\lambda$ is thus the probability of decay per nucleus per unit of time. A more intuitive representation of exponential decay is the time required for the decaying quantity to fall to one half of its initial value. This time, $t_{1/2}$, is called \"half-life\", and can be written in terms of the decay constant as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} \\ . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider here Carbon-14, for which the decay constant is $\\lambda \\sim 1.21 \\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$, and which has a half-life $t_{1/2} \\sim 5728$ yr. Its presence in organic materials is the basis of the radiocarbon dating method to date archaeological, geological and hydrogeological samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(A)** Implement _**your own version**_ of the **Euler and Runge Kutta (order 2) algorithms**, and solve the differential equation above by using these methods. Compare the results you obtain to the analytic solution, which can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ N = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\ ,$$\n",

    "**(B)** Compute your solution for a sufficient number of steps so that you can determine the **half-life** of Carbon-14. Pay attention to the size of the time-step you are using, and discuss your results when using different time-steps. Which method recovers a value of the half-life that is closer to the real one?"
